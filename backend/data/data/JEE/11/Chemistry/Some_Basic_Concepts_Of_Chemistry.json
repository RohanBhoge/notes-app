Wait, the source option says (C) 200 g/mol but the calculation shows 400. Let's re-read the source carefully. Source solution 24: `32/x * 100 = 8 => x = 400`. The source explicitly says `Ans:-(C)` but the calculation clearly leads to 400. Option A is 400. Option C is 200. There is a contradiction in the source's Answer key vs Calculation. \nStandard calculation: Min MW = $32 / 0.08 = 400$. \nThe source text says `Ans:-(C)` but solution text says `compound = 400 g mol-1`. This matches Option A. \nHowever, looking closely at the source solution block, it calculates 400. I will provide the calculated solution (400) but note the source ambiguity if needed. Or I will check if I misread the question. 8% Sulphur. 32 is 8% of 400. So 400 is correct. Option A is 400. Option C is 200. The source Answer Key says (C) but the Solution text computes 400. I will prioritize the mathematical solution correctness which usually matches Option A. But strictly following the source extraction role, I should list the Answer Key provided in the source. \nSource Key: C. Source Solution: 400. \nI will list Answer as (C) to reflect the source document, but the solution step will show the derivation for 400. (User note: This is a discrepancy in the original PDF).",
