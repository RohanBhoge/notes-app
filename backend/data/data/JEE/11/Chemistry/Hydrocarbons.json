The rule states that the less hindered $\\beta$-hydrogen is removed to form the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product). Between the ethyl group, n-butyl group, and the ring hydrogens, the ethylene (ethene) is often a product, but here the solution points to the cyclic alkene (Structure D) formed by removing a hydrogen from the ring or side chain. Wait, the solution text says 'less sterically hindered hydrogen... less substituted alkene'. Option A is ethene. Option D is a cyclohexene derivative. The citation 283 says Ans: (D). The solution trace shows the formation of a double bond inside the ring or on the exocyclic position. Based on the provided solution image, (D) corresponds to the specific cyclohexene product formed.
