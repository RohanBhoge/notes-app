I will extract based on logic and standard question types. The source text marks (B) as answer but the text 'A cap B = phi' appears in the solution line which is likely an error in the source text or OCR, given the calculation shows they meet. Let's look closely at source [206] and [209]. [206] Options B is 'A cap B = (C)...' very garbled. But [209] says 'A and B meet on (0, 1)'. If they meet, intersection is not empty.
